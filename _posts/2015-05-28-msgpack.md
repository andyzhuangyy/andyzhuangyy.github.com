# msgpack

MessagePack is an object serialization specification like JSON.

MessagePack has two concepts: type system and formats.

Serialization is conversion from application objects into MessagePack formats via MessagePack type system.

Deserialization is conversion from MessagePack formats into application objects via MessagePack type system.

    Serialization:
    Application objects
    -->  MessagePack type system
    -->  MessagePack formats (byte array)

    Deserialization:
    MessagePack formats (byte array)
    -->  MessagePack type system
    -->  Application objects
